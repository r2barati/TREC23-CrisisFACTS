Environmental conditions became increasingly conducive to reorganization on September 8 as NOAA Hurricane Hunters began reconnaissance of the cyclone, with the shear decreasing and warm waters becoming deeper
 associated request ID: CrisisFACTS-004-r12
Florence is slowly recovering from the dry air its circulation ingested while it was under the influence of strong shear. Convection in the outer bands is relatively thin but is deeper and more persistent near the center.  Now that the shear has decreased and the warm waters ahead of Florence reach deeper into the ocean, continued strengthening is anticipated. In fact, the official forecast continues to show a period of rapid intensification, now beginning 12-24 hours, with Florence reaching major hurricane intensity between 36-48 hours.
