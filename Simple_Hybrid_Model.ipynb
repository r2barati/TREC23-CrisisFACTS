        "## Submission\n",
        "regarding the submissions: five runs so we can put different focuses on 5 runs.\n",

        "* 1-2 weeks on data analysis + short text method\n",

Early Sunday, the winds were largely blowing in the mountains and foothills, with gusts from 35 mph to 70 mph, but high winds failed to materialize in the burn areas, which helped firefighters greatly in their efforts to douse hot spots.
